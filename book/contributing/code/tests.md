# Running Symfony Tests

The Symfony project uses a CI (Continuous Integration) service which automatically runs tests
for any submitted :doc:`patch </contributing/code/pull_requests>`. If the new code breaks any test,
the pull request will show an error message with a link to the full error details.

In any case, it's a good practice to run tests locally before submitting a
:doc:`patch </contributing/code/pull_requests>` for inclusion, to check that you have not broken anything.

## Before Running the Tests

To run the Symfony test suite, install the external dependencies used during the
tests, such as Doctrine, Twig and Monolog. To do so,
`install Composer`_ and execute the following:

```terminal
$ composer update

```
.. tip::

    Dependencies might fail to update and in this case Composer might need you to
    tell it what Symfony version you are working on.
    To do so set `COMPOSER_ROOT_VERSION` variable, e.g.:

    .. code-block:: terminal

        $ COMPOSER_ROOT_VERSION=7.2.x-dev composer update

## Running the Tests

Then, run the test suite from the Symfony root directory with the following
command:

```terminal
$ php ./phpunit symfony

```
The output should display `OK`. If not, read the reported errors to figure out
what's going on and if the tests are broken because of the new code.

.. tip::

    The entire Symfony suite can take up to several minutes to complete. If you
    want to test a single component, type its path after the `phpunit` command,
    e.g.:

    .. code-block:: terminal

        $ php ./phpunit src/Symfony/Component/Finder/

.. tip::

    On Windows, install the `Cmder`_, `ConEmu`_, `ANSICON`_ or `Mintty`_ free applications
    to see colored test results.

## Testing Generated Code

Some tests generate code on the fly and verify that it matches the expected
output stored in a file. To regenerate those files, run the tests with the
environment variable `TEST_GENERATE_FIXTURES` set to `1`:

```terminal
$ TEST_GENERATE_FIXTURES=1 php ./phpunit src/Symfony/Component/Config/Tests/Builder/GeneratedConfigTest.php

```
